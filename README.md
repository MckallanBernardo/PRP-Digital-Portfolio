## Create a CV
### Evidence:
![Create a CV](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fa72947-07c6-4585-8c6c-fa9e4b1c3d3a)
### Reflection(STAR Technique):
In the "Create a CV" program, there is useful and detailed information that goes into creating a CV, such as advice and the "DO's and DONT's". I was asked to absorb this information and was tested with small chapter quizzes and a short exam at the end of the program. I read through the program thoroughly and answered all the questions as best I could. Coming out of this program I have a much better understanding of what makes a good CV.

## CV Submission
### Evidence:
![CV Sub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d62cf74d-3567-4b22-a783-82c908883d27)
### Reflection(STAR Technique):
The "CV Submission" was all about taking what I have learned in the "Create a CV" program and putting it into practice. Once that was done I was to upload the document. I successfully created a CV that I can now use to apply for jobs.
